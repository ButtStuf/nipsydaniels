GODADDY DNS CONFLICT RESOLUTION
==============================

ERROR: "www conflicts with another value"
SOLUTION: Delete existing www record first

STEP-BY-STEP FIX:
================

1. IN GODADDY DNS MANAGEMENT:
   - Look for existing "www" record
   - DELETE the existing www record first
   - Then add the new CNAME record

2. COMMON EXISTING RECORDS TO DELETE:
   - www → points to @ (A record)
   - www → points to domain.com (CNAME)
   - www → points to parking page

3. AFTER DELETING EXISTING www RECORD:
   - Add new CNAME record:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www
   - Value: ButtStuf.github.io
   - TTL: 1 Hour

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
====================
If you can't delete the existing www record:

1. CHANGE THE EXISTING www RECORD:
   - Edit the existing www record
   - Change the value to: ButtStuf.github.io
   - Change type to CNAME if it's an A record

2. OR USE DIFFERENT NAME:
   - Instead of "www", use "www2" or "web"
   - But "www" is preferred for the main site

FINAL DNS CONFIGURATION:
========================
After resolving conflict:

A RECORDS (4 records):
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.108.153
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.109.153
